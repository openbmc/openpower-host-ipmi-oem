## Command Documentation

### BMC Factory Reset
Netfun: 0x3a
Command: 0x11

This command will call to reset the BMC to its factory default. See [here][0]
for the factory reset implementation details.

This includes:
1. Set the BMC to perform factory reset on reboot.
2. Power the chassis off. The host needs to be powered off because the factory
reset deletes the inventory items, and causes the subsequent power on to fail.
An enhancement to OpenBMC would be to handle missing inventory items during
a BMC reboot when the host is on.
3. Reboot the BMC for the factory reset to take effect.

Because the chassis is powered off, the host does not receive a return code
when successful.

This command is not allowed when the IPMI restriction mode is set to
'Whitelist'.  See [here][1] for more information.
